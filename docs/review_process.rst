Infrastructure Requests
=======================

The infrastructure committee has the role of managing project digital infrastructure in a fair, equitable manner, and this requires a process to match.

Commitments from the infrastructure committee
---------------------------------------------

- Acknowledgement of the issue within a **week**
- Reviews are done undertaken within a **month** of opening an issue
- Ideally, there will be **two reviewers per issue**
- If approved, a **time frame for action** to occur is agreed
- If rejected, a **reason** must be given

Review Process
--------------

- A project member opens an issue on the infrastructure repository using one of the provided templates.
  This will alert to each member of the committee.
- Each reviewer fills out the reviewer template within the given time frame.
- If the reviewers reject the proposal, the issue should be closed as not planned, and the author can not appeal.
- If the reviewers approve the proposal, the issue should only be closed as completed when the task is completed.
- If the reviewers are split, another member of the committee is asked to review, and then their decision counts as the final vote.

The following template should be used for the review:

.. code-block:: markdown

Appeal Process
--------------

In the cases where project members feel that their issue was unfairly closed, there will be no appeals process.

Reporting to the Board
----------------------

Updates on all project requests that were denied will be given to the board to ensure that the infrastructure committee is not rejecting valid requests.
